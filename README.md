## üó£Ô∏è About

This template was developed for solving üåü Advent of Code üéÑ puzzles. It includes a [framework](https://github.com/appinha/aoc_framework) for automating repetitive tasks and a [library](https://github.com/appinha/aoc_lib) with useful tools for solving the puzzles.

The framework automates repetitive tasks such as:
- creating the necessary files for solving the puzzles of a given day;
- downloading one's personal input;
- reading and formatting the input text;
- running the solving code for a given day, both for one's personal input and testing inputs;
- testing of multiple different inputs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

- `Python 3.10`
- `termcolor`
- `make` (for running `Makefile`)

### Instructions

0. [Create a new repo from this template, git clone it and start submodules](#0-create-a-new-repo-from-this-template-git-clone-it-and-start-submodules)
1. [Configure the config.ini file](#1-configure-the-configini-file)
2. [Create a new day folder from template](#2-create-a-new-day-folder-from-template)
3. [Fill in the input files](#3-fill-in-the-input-files)
4. [Write the solving code in the `main.py` file](#4-write-the-solving-code-in-the-mainpy-file)
5. [Run the puzzle solver](#5-run-the-puzzle-solver)

#### 0. Create a new repo from this template, git clone it and start submodules

To create a new repo from this template, click on "Use this template", then on "Create a new repository":

![Screenshot showing how to use this template to create a new repository on GitHub](img/use_this_template.png)

After creating a new repository from this template, git clone it and start submodules:

```shell
$ git clone <your_cloned_repo.git>
$ cd your_cloned_repo
$ git submodule update --init
```

#### 1. Configure the config.ini file

To enable automated downloading of your personal input from the AoC website, on the `my_solutions/config.ini` file, fill in the **year** of the AoC edition you will be solving and your personal **session cookie**.

_**Note:** to get your session cookie, open the AoC website and log in to your account; open DevTools (inspect) and go to the "Application" tab; on the left menu, under "Storage", click on "Cookies", then on the AoC url; from the table, copy the value of the "session" entry._

#### 2. Create a new day folder from template

```shell
$ make new d=01
```

![Output from running `make new day=01`](img/make_new.png)

_Note: the `make` commands have to be run from the cloned folder's root, i.e. from where the `Makefile` is placed._

The resulting folder structure will be:
```
your_cloned_repo
  my_solutions
    aoc_framework
      ...
    aoc_lib
      ...
    config.ini
    day_01
      input_test.txt
      input.txt
      main.py
      README.md
      solutions.txt
  Makefile
```

#### 3. Fill in the input files

For your **personal input**, upon creating a new day folder from template, it is automatically downloaded from the AoC website and pasted into the `input.txt` file.

If an error occurred while downloading your input upon creating the new day folder, you can try again with:

```shell
$ make input d=01
```

For **testing inputs**, add them in the `input_test.txt` file in substitution of the text `INPUT` and add the expected result in substitution of the `?` character. The line `<--->` is used to separate inputs for a given puzzle part, while the line `<===>` separates inputs from each puzzle part. In the example below, there are 3 testing inputs for part 1 and 2 testing inputs for part 2:

```
2x3x4
:-> solution=58 <-:

<--->

1x1x10
:-> solution=43 <-:

<--->

2x3x4
1x1x10
:-> solution=101 <-:

<===>

2x3x4
:-> solution=34 <-:

<--->

1x1x10
:-> solution=14 <-:
```

_(test inputs for AoC 2015 day 02 puzzle)_

#### 4. Write the solving code in the `main.py` file

The solving code for each part of the puzzle have to be written as the methods `solve_part_1` and `solve_part_2` of the `DayPuzzleSolver` class:

```python
class DayPuzzleSolver():
    def __init__(self):
        self.delimiter = ""

    def solve_part_1(self, raw_input):
        ...

    def solve_part_2(self, raw_input):
        ...
```

The `self.delimiter` parameter determines how the text from the input file should be broken down. The result is then passed as the `raw_input` parameter of the solving methods. For example:

- `""` (empty string) - the input text remains the same, i.e. `raw_input` will be a string containing the input text in whole, for example, [AoC 2015 day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1):
```
(((())))()((((((((())()
```

- `"\n"` - to be used when the input should be broken down line by line, i.e. `raw_input` will be a list of strings (lines), for example, [AoC 2015 day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2):
```
20x3x11
15x27x5
6x29x7
```

- `"\n\n"` - to be used when the input is written in blocks and should be broken down by so, i.e. `raw_input` will be a list of strings (blocks of lines), for example, [AoC 2020 day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4):
```
cid:83 pid:524032739 iyr:2013 ecl:amb byr:1974
hgt:191cm hcl:#ceb3a1 eyr:2028

ecl:gry hcl:eefed5 pid:88405792 hgt:183cm cid:221 byr:1963 eyr:2029

pid:777881168 ecl:grn
hgt:181cm byr:1923 eyr:2021 iyr:2018 hcl:#18171d

```

#### 5. Run the puzzle solver

for a certain day (both parts):

```shell
$ make d=02
```

![Output from running `make day=01`](img/make_day.png)

for a certain day and part:

```shell
$ make d=04 p=1
```

```shell
$ make d=08 p=2
```

for testing input:

```shell
$ make test d=12
```

```shell
$ make test d=12 p=1
```

![Output from running `make test day=01`](img/make_test.png)

## üåü What is *Advent of Code*?

	üöÄ TLDR: an online event where a two-part programming puzzle is released each day from Dec 1st to the 25th.

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). In his words:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
